# Microcontroller controlled chemical reactions - Titration
## Proposal
We wish to use microcontrollers to control a chemical reaction. As an example we have chosen Titration. This is mainly because this is a slightly less complicated chemical reaction, with a stable endpoint following which no reaction will occur.

## Components used:
### 1. RP2040

We have used both the RP2040 QtPy as well as the RP2040 Pico4ML in setting up our project.

### 2. Titration Kit

For titration, our primary component from the kit is te burette, whose know allows control of the flow of reagents into the reaction. The beaker is where the reaction will take place and the endpoint will be sensed. The clamp stand will be used to prop the burette up. As far as the chemicals go, we have currently decided on using Dilute Hydrochloric Acid as the acid, dilute Potassium Hydroxide as the base and phenopthalein as the indicator. We plan to meet with a chemistry professor for some of the components, and so this is subject to change.

### 3. APDS9960

We have used the APDS9960 to sense the color change when the end point is reached.

### 4. Motor

We have ordered the NEMA-17 stepper motor and corresponding motor driver because of its high speed and torque. However, due to logistical delays, we have experimented with the parallax servo motor.
