# Microcontroller controlled chemical reactions - Titration
## Proposal
We wish to use microcontrollers to control a chemical reaction. As an example we have chosen Titration. This is mainly because this is a slightly less complicated chemical reaction, with a stable endpoint following which no reaction will occur.
